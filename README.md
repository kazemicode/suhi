# Course Catalog and Scheduling Wizard

The purpose of this project is to provide a course catalog and scheduling wizard for Sweetwater High School, a public high school that serves 2700 students with only seven counselors. The main goal for this project is to minimize the amount of time counselors and students must meet during class time for preregistration consultations. The scheduling wizard empowers students to be able to prepare their own course list before meeting with the counselor, mitigating the need for the counselor to explain courses to the student at length.
